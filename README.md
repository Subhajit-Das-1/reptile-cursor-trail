# reptile-cursor-trail
A simple and interactive JavaScript project that creates a reptile-like cursor trail effect with animated green dots following the mouse movement.
## How It Works
- Uses JS to track mouse position
- Animates a chain of 20 dots following the cursor
- Clean, no external libraries
